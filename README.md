Project information-

This project was made with sub-theme 1 in mind, which is "Cybersecurity's role in financial in personal safety". Our project is a website which serves as a hub for various cybersecurity solutions (with special emphasis on financial security), featuring various quizzes to determine whether or not you are safe online. We offer multiple subscription plans which include device scans as well multiple courses on cybersecurity and financial safety. We also allow customers to register complaints to us in case they have fallen victim to any cyber crimes, or seek help with securing themselves online. 

The 'navbar' at the top of the home page contains buttons that take you to various part of the site. The 'about' section provides information about our services and mission. The 'services' section details our services and specific purposes. The 'safety test' section contains links to 2 surveys. The first survey contains questions regarding your online practices and functioning of your devices to determine whether or not you are at risk of falling victim to a cybercrime. The second survey tests your knowledge on cyber security to help you learn about the same in case you are unaware of some important points of information. The 'pricing' section contains information about the pricing of our subscription plans and all their benefits. Lastly, the 'contact' section contains a link to a form where you can seek help with securing yourself online or register a complaint if you are a cybercrime victim. There is also a 'sign up' button which allows you to create an account through which you may avail our services.

This project was made using Django, HTML and CSS
